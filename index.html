                Dragon Project Revision and Reflection
            </h2>
            <p>
                I was able to get feedback from my mother and she thought it was dull, but at that time I only had one picture and really no colors. I took that feedback,
                and put more color and pictures into each web page. I made sure that the colors scheme was consitent through out all web pages. I gave each web page a blue, gray, and white, which
                 made all the webpages look consistent. I've learned alot from this class, and it gave me the knowledge to create a webpage. I felt I did well with imagery, and 
                organization of sections in the HTML. I had a hard time with the CSS and if were to do it over again I would probably put more effort into the CSS. During this project and semester,
                I had a hard time positioning imagery and sections to where I want them to go. I would have also help to have what the different values mean (for example px, vw, em, and etc.). I never 
                had a clear understanding the values and positioning.

                Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement
            </h2>
            <p>
                From what I interpreted from the article on progressive enhancement, I think progressive enhancement is a way to describe the different layers of a web design.
                In the article in described progressive enhancement as an peanut M&M, which I think is a perfect way to describe web desgin and how it layered. The peanut in the M&M is
                is the HTML, which is the foundation of the M&M and in the case of the M&M the chocolate and the shell are layered over the peanut and without the peanut it, would not be
                a peanut M&M.<br><br> Article goes on to describe the chocolate as the CSS of web design, which is true. CSS brings out the HTML, making the web appeal and bring awe to the veiwer, and
                just as the chocolate in the peanut M&M, the chocolate combined with the peanut allows for a memorable and fiending enjoyment with the site. Lastly, the shell of the peanut M&M is 
                Java Script and this gives the viewer of the website a more interactive website experience. The shell gives the peanut M&M a way to intereact and keep the chocolate and peanut together.
